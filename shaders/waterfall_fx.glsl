// Surface shader: Waterfall FALLS churn-ribbon FX (Synty ElvenRealm "Shader Graphs/Waterfall",
// GUID 87c14512 — the white/cyan churn planes at the falls' lips, material WaterFall_Top_FX).
//
// THIS FILE IS PROJECT/EXAMPLE-SIDE, NOT AN ENGINE BUILT-IN — the FALLS sibling of
// water_stylized.glsl (FLOW). It reads only the generic user-param block (Mat.uUser0/uUser1),
// the always-bound per-view time (Light.uTimeParams.y, the bounded scroll clock), and THREE textures resolved by NAME:
// one engine well-known slot (albedoMap) plus two USER-DECLARED slots. That pair is the living
// demo of named-slot resolution: a project surface mints its own texture names in the tag block
// below and samples them via GE_USER_TEXTURE(name); the composer packs each user name into the
// lowest free slot and the .material binds them by the same name in its "textures" object.
// Nothing engine-side knows the word "waterfall". SELF-CONTAINED surface only: user names must
// never be mixed with raw-ordinal texture access (the composer rejects that combination).
//
// Unity ground truth (GeneratedFromGraph-Waterfall.shader, SurfaceDescriptionFunction):
//   panUV    = uv0 + 0.01 * _Speed.xy * time             (the graph's own 0.01 damping)
//   churn    = tex(_Texture_01, panUV)                   (panned ribbon color + alpha)
//   detail   = tex(_Texture_02, uv0)                     (static brightness modulation)
//   mask     = tex(_Texture_03, uv0)                     (static fade mask; only .a is read)
//   Emission = _Water_Color * churn * (_Brightness * detail)      -- UNCONDITIONAL
//   Alpha    = churn.a * mask.a
//   BaseColor = linear(0.5 grey), Metallic 0, Smoothness 0.5      -- graph CONSTANTS, not .mat props
//
// Blend: the material authors _SURFACE_TYPE_TRANSPARENT + _ALPHAPREMULTIPLY_ON with
// Blend One OneMinusSrcAlpha (URP preserve-specular premultiply). The port keeps that exact
// structure: the .material authors blend {One, OneMinusSrcAlpha}; this surface premultiplies
// the DIFFUSE base by alpha (URP's AlphaModulate touches only albedo), leaves specular and
// emission un-premultiplied, and writes alpha for the destination attenuation. Where the
// ribbon alpha thins, the emission still ADDS over the falls — the additive-looking churn
// glow — while dense ribbon cores also occlude the background. Exactly Unity's math.
//
// Emission units: the product is scene-linear against the OpenPBR emission lobe's paperwhite
// anchor (1.0 == GE_EMISSION_PAPERWHITE_NITS == 203 nits), the same convention as
// water_stylized's user7 lane; the authored _Brightness carries 1:1.
//
// Generic user-param mapping (authored by NAME in the .material, no engine lane per property):
//   Mat.uUser0 = (panSpeedU, panSpeedV, brightness, unused)   -> "user0".."user2"
//     panSpeed is EFFECTIVE UV/sec: the converter folds the graph's 0.01 damping into the
//     authored _Speed and negates V (the FBX importer's V flip inverts apparent V motion;
//     U is untouched). FALLS ships _Speed = (20, 0) -> (0.2, 0): a pure U pan along the rim.
//   Mat.uUser1.rgb = _Water_Color (linearized)                -> "user4".."user6"
//
// Declared texture set. The tag must lead its comment line; these three lines ARE the
// declarations (albedoMap = _Texture_01: the well-known name keeps canonical slot 0 and its
// ST row; churnDetail = _Texture_02 and fadeMask = _Texture_03 are user names — the composer
// assigns their slots, so they are sampled ONLY via GE_USER_TEXTURE, never by ordinal).
// @texture albedoMap   srgb
// @texture churnDetail srgb
// @texture fadeMask    srgb
